# arctan-bitflags
Bitflag structures with 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128-bit representation.

## Primary Types

- `BitFlags8`:   8-bit flags that convert to and from `u8`.
- `BitFlags16`:  16-bit flags that convert to and from `u16`.
- `BitFlags32`:  32-bit flags that convert to and from `u32`.
- `BitFlags64`:  64-bit flags that convert to and from `u64`.
- `BitFlags128`: 128-bit flags that convert to and from `u128`.

## Usage

### Creation

A new empty instance:
```rust
let flags = BitFlags8::new();

let flags = BitFlags8::empty();
```

A new instance with all bits set:
```rust
let flags = BitFlags8::full();

let flags = BitFlags8::from_u8(u8::MAX);

let flags = BitFlags8::from(u8::MAX);
```

A new instance from corresponding integer (all below are identical):
```rust
let flags = BitFlags8(0b0110);

let flags = BitFlags8::from_u8(0b0110);

let flags = BitFlags8::from(6u8);

let flags: BitFlags8 = 6u8.into();
```

A new instance from a bit index:
```rust
let flags = BitFlags8::from_index(2);
```

A new instance from a slice of indexes:
```rust
let flags = BitFlags8::from_slice(&[2, 4, 5]);
```

### Bit Manipulation

Operations:
```rust
let flags1 = BitFlags8(0b1001);
let flags2 = BitFlags8(0b0001);

assert_eq!(flags1 | flags2, BitFlags8(0b1001)); // BitOr
assert_eq!(flags1 & flags2, BitFlags8(0b0000)); // BitAnd
assert_eq!(flags1 ^ flags2, BitFlags8(0b0011)); // BitXor
assert_eq!(!flags1, BitFlags8(0b1111_1110)); // Not
```

Insertion:
```rust
// Final result: `0b1101`
let mut flags1 = BitFlags8(0b0001);
let flags2 = BitFlags8(0b1001);
flags1.insert(flags2);
flags1.insert_at_index(2);
```

Intersection:
```rust
let flags1 = BitFlags8(0b1001);
let flags2 = BitFlags8(0b0001);
let flags3 = BitFlags8(0b1111);

assert!(flags2.intersects(flags1));
assert!(flags3.contains(flags1));
assert_eq!(flags1.intersection(flags2), BitFlags8(0b0001));
```

Union:
```rust
let flags1 = BitFlags8(0b1001);
let flags2 = BitFlags8(0b0001);

assert_eq!(flags1.union(flags2), BitFlags8(0b1001));
```

## Goals

The primary purpose for creation of this library is for *games*. I wanted a bitflag type that met the following criteria:

1. Specific: a type that is explicitly designated for use as a bitflag. While the primitive integer types (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`) use

2. Flexible: ease of conversion to and from the relevant primitive type.

3. Intuitive: exposes an interface one would reasonably expect bitflags to have.

4. Iteration: ability to iterate over set bits by their bit index.

5. Works with lists of external `String`s: use auxillary structs to map `String` keys to `BitFlag` values. This is useful for making custom `enum`-like objects from external data.

## Credit and Inspirations

I wanted something like the excellent `bitflags` crate without having to define flags in a `struct` with named fields. Many of my games and utilities use flags and enums derived from external (deserialized) lists of strings. As such, this library was born.
